This is a method on How to Execute File into Memory without Touching Disk in C#

Execute File in Memory Using Keyauth File ID's
This method allows you to execute a file directly from memory in your C# application, without saving it to disk. We achieve this by downloading the file from the Keyauth server using its File ID and then loading it into memory to execute. This process ensures that the file doesn't touch the disk, making it faster and more secure.

**Step-by-Step Guide**
1. Get the File ID from Keyauth
- First, you need to upload the file you want to execute to the Keyauth platform.
- After uploading, Keyauth will provide a File ID for your file. This is the unique identifier that allows you to access the file through their API.

**3. Prepare Your C# Application**
- In your C# application, make sure you have the necessary API Key and File ID.
- You can either create a new application or add this functionality to an existing one.
- Add All of the Files included in this Project to your Source Code

**5. Download the File from Keyauth**
- Using the Keyauth File ID and API Key, you can download the file directly into your applicationâ€™s memory. This is done without saving the file to disk, so it's all handled in memory for better security.
Like this (It is neccessarry to use the KeyAuth.cs from the Files):
Memory.ExecuteFile(choose.FortniteAUTH.download("YOUR FILE CODE OF YOUR KEYAUTH"), Path.Combine(RuntimeEnvironment.GetRuntimeDirectory(), "YOUR EXE FILE - OTHER FILE TYPES ARE NOT SUPPORTED"), "");

**7. Execute the File in Memory**
- After downloading the file, the file is loaded into memory (like a byte array).
- Your existing method for executing the file will then take over, using the data from memory, bypassing the need for file system interaction.

**9. Testing the Execution**
- Run the application to test whether the file is being executed correctly from memory.
- If everything is set up properly, the file will execute as intended without leaving traces on the file system.

**Benefits of Executing Files from Memory**
- No File Storage: No need to write the file to disk, reducing potential security risks and clutter.
- Faster Execution: File operations in memory can be faster than reading and writing from disk.
- Increased Security: Since the file never touches the disk, it's harder for malicious actors to access or alter it.
  
**Final Thoughts**
This method is a great way to securely execute files in C# without relying on file system storage. By using Keyauth's File ID, you can easily retrieve files and execute them directly in memory, making your application more efficient and secure.
